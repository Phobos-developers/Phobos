**Phobos** is a WIP community project providing a set of new features and fixes for Yuri's Revenge based on [modified YRpp](https://github.com/Metadorius/YRpp) and [Syringe](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Syringe) to allow injecting code. It's meant to accompany [Ares](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Ares) rather than replace it, thus it won't introduce incompatibilities.

For now you can discuss the project at a dedicated [channel on C&C Mod Haven](https://discord.gg/sZeMzz6qVg) (which is my C&C modding server).

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Phobos-developers/Phobos/wiki) to see the full list of features.

Building
--------

Windows:

0. Install Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" workload, "C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017 (v141) tools" individual component and clone this repo recursively.
1. Open the solution file in VS and build it.

Upon build completion place the resulting `Phobos.dll` in your YR directory and launch Syringe targeting your YR executable (usually `gamemd.exe`).

You can also get test a nightly version for a specific commit which is built automatically with a GitHub Actions workflow, just press on a green tick, open the workflow, find and download the build artifact (a ZIP containing the extension's DLL). Those versions have build information (commit and branch/tag) in them which is displayed ingame and can't be turned off. **Those versions are bleeding edge, do not redistribute them in mods!**
