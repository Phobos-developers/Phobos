**Phobos** is a WIP community project providing a set of new features and fixes for Yuri's Revenge based on [modified YRpp](https://github.com/Metadorius/YRpp) and [Syringe](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Syringe) to allow injecting code. It's meant to accompany [Ares](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Ares) rather than replace it, thus it won't introduce incompatibilities.

For now you can discuss the project at a dedicated [channel on C&C Mod Haven](https://discord.gg/sZeMzz6qVg) (which is my C&C modding server).


Building and Usage
------------------

0. Install **Visual Studio** (2019 is recommended, 2017 is minimum) with the dependencies listed in `.vswhere` (it will prompt you to install missing dependences when you open the project, or you can run VS installer and import the config). If you prefer to use **Visual Studio Code** you may install **VS Build Tools** with the stuff from `.vswhere` instead. You can also don't use any code editor or IDE and build via **command line scripts** included with the project.
1. Clone this repo recursively via your favorite git client (that will also clone YRpp).
2. To build the extension:
  - in Visual Studio: open the solution file in VS and build it (`Debug` build config is recommended);
  - in VSCode: open the project folder and hit `Run Build Task...` (`Ctrl + Shift + B`);
  - barebones: run `scripts/build_devbuild.bat`.
3. Upon build completion place the resulting `Phobos.dll` from folder named identical to the used build config in your YR directory and launch Syringe targeting your YR executable (usually `gamemd.exe`).

You can also get a nightly build for those who want to help testing Phobos features as soon as they are done. Those versions are bleeding edge (don't redistribute them outside of testing!) and have build information (commit and branch/tag) in them which is displayed ingame and can't be turned off. There are two ways get a nightly build.
- **Get an artifact via nightly.link**. This is a service that allows guests to download automatic builds from GitHub. You can get a build for the latest successful (marked with a green tick) `develop` branch commit via [this link](https://nightly.link/Phobos-developers/Phobos/blob/develop/.github/workflows/nightly.yml), or get a build for any up-to-date pull request via an automatic comment that would appear in it. 
- **Get an artifact manually from GitHub Actions runs**. You can get an artifact for a specific commit which is built automatically with a GitHub Actions workflow, just press on a green tick, open the workflow, find and download the build artifact. This is limited to authorized users only.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation can be found at [here @ Read the Docs](https://phobos.readthedocs.io) and is split by a few major categories (similiar to Ares docs), each represented with a page on the sidebar. Each page has it's contents grouped into multiple subcategories, be it buildings, technotypes, infantry, superweapons or something else.

You can switch between versions in the bottom left corner, as well as download a PDF version.

How to read code snippets
-------------------------

```ini
; which section the params should be in
; can be a freeform name - in this case the comment would explain what it is
; if no comment to be found - then it's a precise name
[SOMENAME] ; BuildingType
; KeyName=DefaultValue ; accepted type with optional explanation
; if there's nothing to the right of equals sign - the default value is empty/absent
UIDescription=<none> ; CSF entry key
```
