# labeler "full" schema

# enable labeler on issues, prs, or both.
enable:
  issues: false
  prs: true
# comments object allows you to specify a different message for issues and prs

# Labels is an object where:
# - keys are labels
# - values are objects of { include: [ pattern ], exclude: [ pattern ] }
#    - pattern must be a valid regex, and is applied globally to
#      title + description of issues and/or prs (see enabled config above)
#    - 'include' patterns will associate a label if any of these patterns match
#    - 'exclude' patterns will ignore this label if any of these patterns match
labels:
  'Minor':
    include:
      - '(?i)\[minor\]'
    exclude: []
