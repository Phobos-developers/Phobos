# What's New

This page lists the history of changes across stable Phobos releases and also all the stuff that requires modders to change something in their mods to accommodate.

## Migrating

```{hint}
You can use the migration utility (can be found on [Phobos supplementaries repo](https://github.com/Phobos-developers/PhobosSupplementaries)) to apply most of the changes automatically using a corresponding sed script file.
```

### From vanilla

- `[CrateRules]` -> `FreeMCV` now controls whether or not player is forced to receive unit from `[General]` -> `BaseUnit` from goodie crate if they own no buildings or any existing `BaseUnit` vehicles and own more than `[CrateRules]` -> `FreeMCV.CreditsThreshold` (defaults to 1500) credits.
- Translucent RLE SHPs will now be drawn using a more precise and performant algorithm that has no green tint and banding. Can be disabled with `rulesmd.ini->[General]->FixTransparencyBlitters=no`.
- Iron Curtain status is now preserved by default when converting between TechnoTypes via `DeploysInto`/`UndeploysInto`. This behavior can be turned off per-TechnoType and global basis using `[SOMETECHNOTYPE]/[CombatDamage]->IronCurtain.KeptOnDeploy=no`.
- The obsolete `[General]` -> `WarpIn` has been enabled for the default anim type when technos are warping in. If you want to restore the vanilla behavior, use the same anim type as `WarpOut`.
- Vehicles with `Crusher=true` + `OmniCrusher=true` / `MovementZone=CrusherAll` were hardcoded to tilt when crushing vehicles / walls respectively. This now obeys `TiltsWhenCrushes` but can be customized individually for these two scenarios using `TiltsWhenCrusher.Vehicles` and `TiltsWhenCrusher.Overlays`, which both default to `TiltsWhenCrushes`.

### From older Phobos versions

#### From post-0.3 devbuilds

- Affected target enum (`CanTarget`, `Crit.Affects` et al) now considers buildings considered vehicles (`ConsideredVehicle=true` or not set in conjunction with `UndeploysInto` & 1x1 foundation) as units instead of buildings.
- If `CreateUnit.AlwaysSpawnOnGround` is set to false, jumpjet vehicles created will now automatically take off instead of staying on ground. Set to true to force spawn on ground.
- Digital display `Offset` and `Offset.ShieldDelta` Y-axis coordinates now work in inverted fashion (negative goes up, positive goes down) to be consistent with how pixel offsets work elsewhere in the game.
- Phobos Warhead effects combined with `CellSpread` now correctly apply to buildings if any of the foundation cells are hit instead of only the top-left most cell (cell #0).
- `ExtraWarheads.DamageOverrides` now falls back to last listed value if list is shorter than `ExtraWarheads` for all Warhead detonations exceeding the length.
- Air and Top layer contents are no longer sorted, animations in these layers no longer respect `YSortAdjust`. Animations attached to flying units now get their layer updated immediately after parent unit, if they are on same layer they will draw above the parent unit.
- `AnimList.ShowOnZeroDamage` has been renamed to `CreateAnimsOnZeroDamage` to make it more clear it applies to both `AnimList` and splash animations.
- INI inclusion and inheritance are now turned off by default and need to be turned on via command line flags `-Include` and `-Inheritance`.
- `Level=true` projectiles no longer attempt to do reposition against targets that are behind non-water tiles by default. Use `SubjectToLand=true` to re-enable this behaviour.

#### From 0.3

- Phobos-introduced Warhead effects like shield modifiers, critical hits, disguise & mind control removal now require Warhead `Verses` to affect target to apply unless `EffectsRequireVerses` is set to false. Shield armor type is used if target has an active shield that cannot be penetrated by the Warhead.
- `Trajectory=Straight` projectiles can now snap on targets within 0.5 cells from their detonation point, this distance can be customized via `Trajectory.Straight.TargetSnapDistance`.
- `LaunchSW.RealLaunch=false` now checks if firing house has enough credits to satisfy SW's `Money.Amount` in order to be fired.
- `CreateUnit` now creates the units by default at animation's height (even if `CreateUnit.ConsiderPathfinding` is enabled) instead of always at ground level. This behaviour can be restored by setting `CreateUnit.AlwaysSpawnOnGround` to true.
- Phobos-introduced attack scripts now consider potential target's current map zone when evaluating targets. [TargetZoneScanType](Fixed-or-Improved-Logics.md#customizable-target-evaluation-map-zone-check-behaviour) can be used to customize this behaviour.
- `Artillary`, `ICBMLauncher`, `TickTank` or `SensorArray` no longer affect whether or not building is considered as vehicle for AI attack scripts. Use [ConsideredVehicle](Fixed-or-Improved-Logics.md#buildings-considered-as-vehicles) instead on buildings that do not have both `UndeploysInto` set and `Foundation=1x1`.
- `PassengerDeletion.SoylentFriendlies` has been replaced by `PassengerDeletion.SoylentAllowedHouses`. Current default value of `PassengerDeletion.SoylentAllowedHouses=enemies` matches the previous default behaviour with `PassengerDeletion.SoylentFriendlies=false`.
- `Grinding.DisplayRefund` is changed to `DisplayIncome`, `Grinding.DisplayRefund.Houses` is changed to `DisplayIncome.Houses`, `Grinding.DisplayRefund.Offset` is changed to `DisplayIncome.Offset`
- `[JumpjetControls]`->`AllowLayerDeviation` and `JumpjetAllowLayerDeviation` have been deprecated as the animation layering issues have been properly fixed by default now.
- `[JumpjetControls]->TurnToTarget` and `JumpjetTurnToTarget` are obsolete. Jumpjet units who fire `OmniFire=no` weapons **always** turn to targets as other units do.
- Buildings delivered by trigger action 125 will now **always** play buildup anim as long as it exists. `[ParamTypes]->53` is deprecated.
- `Shadow` for debris & meteor animations is changed to `ExtraShadow`.

#### From pre-0.3 devbuilds

- `Trajectory.Speed` is now defined on projectile instead of weapon.
- `Gravity=0` is not supported anymore as it will cause the projectile to fly backwards and be unable to hit the target which is not at the same height. Use `Straight` Trajectory instead. See [here](New-or-Enhanced-Logics.md#projectile-trajectories).
- Automatic self-destruction logic logic has been reimplemented, `Death.NoAmmo`, `Death.Countdown` and `Death.Peaceful` tags have been remade/renamed and require adjustments to function.
- `DetachedFromOwner` on weapons is deprecated. This has been replaced by `AllowDamageOnSelf` on warheads.
- Timed jump script actions now take the time measured in ingame seconds instead of frames. Divide your value by 15 to accommodate to this change.
- [Placement Preview](User-Interface.md#placement-preview) logic has been adjusted, `BuildingPlacementPreview.DefaultTranslucentLevel`, `BuildingPlacementGrid.TranslucentLevel`, `PlacementPreview.Show`, `PlacementPreview.TranslucentLevel` and `ShowBuildingPlacementPreview` tags have been remade/renamed and require adjustments to function. In addition, you must explicitly enable this feature by specifying `[AudioVisual]->PlacementPreview=yes`.
- Existing script actions were renumbered, please use the migration utility to change the numbers to the correct ones.
- `DiskLaser.Radius` values were misinterpreted by a factor of 1/2π. The default radius is now 240, please multiply your customized radii by 2π.

#### From 0.2.2.2

- Keys `rulesmd.ini->[SOMEWARHEAD]->PenetratesShield` and `rulesmd.ini->[SOMEWARHEAD]->BreaksShield` have been changed to `Shield.Penetrate` and `Shield.Break`, respectively.
- `Rad.NoOwner` on weapons is deprecated. This has been replaced by `RadHasOwner` key on radiation types itself. It also defaults to no, so radiation once again has no owner house by default.
- `RadApplicationDelay` and `RadApplicationDelay.Building` on custom radiation types are now only used if `[Radiation]` -> `UseGlobalRadApplicationDelay` is explicitly set to false, otherwise values from `[Radiation]` are used.
- Existing script actions were renumbered, please use the migration utility to change the numbers to the correct ones.

#### From 0.1.1

- Key `rulesmd.ini->[SOMETECHNOTYPE]->Deployed.RememberTarget` is deprecated and can be removed now, the bugfix for `DeployToFire` deployers is now always on.

### New user settings in RA2MD.ini

- These are new user setting keys added by various features in Phobos. Most of them can be found in either in [user inteface](User-Interface.md) or [miscellaneous](Miscellanous.md) sections. Search functionality can be used to find them quickly if needed.
