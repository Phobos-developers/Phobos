# What's New

This page lists the history of changes across stable Phobos releases and also all the stuff that requires modders to change something in their mods to accomodate.

## Migrating

```{hint}
You can use the migration utility (can be found on [Phobos supplementaries repo](https://github.com/Phobos-developers/PhobosSupplementaries)) to apply most of the changes automatically using a corresponding sed script file.
```

### From vanilla

- SHP debris hardcoded shadows now respect `Shadow=no` tag value, and due to it being the default value they wouldn't have hardcoded shadows anymore by default. Override this by specifying `Shadow=yes` for SHP debris.
- Translucent RLE SHPs will now be drawn using a more precise and performant algorithm that has no green tint and banding. Can be disabled with `rulesmd.ini->[General]->FixTransparencyBlitters=no`.
- Iron Curtain status is now preserved by default when converting between TechnoTypes via `DeploysInto`/`UndeploysInto`. This behavior can be turned off per-TechnoType and global basis using `[SOMETECHNOTYPE]/[CombatDamage]->IronCurtain.KeptOnDeploy=no`.

### From older Phobos versions

#### From pre-0.3 devbuilds

- `Trajectory.Speed` is now defined on projectile instead of weapon.
- `Gravity=0` is not supported anymore as it will cause the projectile to fly backwards and be unable to hit the target which is not at the same height. Use `Straight` Trajectory instead. See [here](New-or-Enhanced-Logics.md#projectile-trajectories).
- Automatic self-destruction logic logic has been reimplemented, `Death.NoAmmo`, `Death.Countdown` and `Death.Peaceful` tags have been remade/renamed and require adjustments to function.
- `DetachedFromOwner` on weapons is deprecated. This has been replaced by `AllowDamageOnSelf` on warheads.
- Timed jump script actions now take the time measured in ingame seconds instead of frames. Divide your value by 15 to accomodate to this change.
- [Placement Preview](User-Interface.md#placement-preview) logic has been adjusted, `BuildingPlacementPreview.DefaultTranslucentLevel`, `BuildingPlacementGrid.TranslucentLevel`, `PlacementPreview.Show`, `PlacementPreview.TranslucentLevel` and `ShowBuildingPlacementPreview` tags have been remade/renamed and require adjustments to function. In addition, you must explicitly enable this feature by specifying `[AudioVisual]->PlacementPreview=yes`.
- Existing script actions were renumbered, please use the migration utility to change the numbers to the correct ones.


#### From 0.2.2.2

- Keys `rulesmd.ini->[SOMEWARHEAD]->PenetratesShield` and `rulesmd.ini->[SOMEWARHEAD]->BreaksShield` have been changed to `Shield.Penetrate` and `Shield.Break`, respectively.
- `Rad.NoOwner` on weapons is deprecated. This has been replaced by `RadHasOwner` key on radiation types itself. It also defaults to no, so radiation once again has no owner house by default.
- `RadApplicationDelay` and `RadApplicationDelay.Building` on custom radiation types are now only used if `[Radiation]` -> `UseGlobalRadApplicationDelay` is explicitly set to false, otherwise values from `[Radiation]` are used.
- Existing script actions were renumbered, please use the migration utility to change the numbers to the correct ones.

#### From 0.1.1

- Key `rulesmd.ini->[SOMETECHNOTYPE]->Deployed.RememberTarget` is deprecated and can be removed now, the bugfix for `DeployToFire` deployers is now always on.
