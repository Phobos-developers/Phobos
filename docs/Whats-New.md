# What's New

This page lists the history of changes across stable Phobos releases and also all the stuff that requires modders to change something in their mods to accomodate.

## Migrating

### From vanilla

- SHP debris hardcoded shadows now respect `Shadow=no` tag value, and due to it being the default value they wouldn't have hardcoded shadows anymore by default. Override this by specifying `Shadow=yes` for SHP debris.
- Radiation now has owner by default, which means that radiation kills will affect score and radiation field will respect `Affects...` tags. You can override that with `rulesmd.ini->[SOMEWEAPONTYPE]->Rad.NoOwner=yes` tag value.

### From older Phobos versions

- Tag `rulesmd.ini->[SOMETECHNOTYPE]->Deployed.RememberTarget` is deprecated and can be removed now, the bugfix for `DeployToFire` deployers is now always on.
