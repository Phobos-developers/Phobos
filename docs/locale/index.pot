msgid "...is a WIP community project providing a set of new features and fixes for Yuri's Revenge based on [modified YRpp](https://github.com/Metadorius/YRpp) and [Syringe](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Syringe) to allow injecting code. It's meant to accompany [Ares](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Ares) rather than replace it, thus it won't introduce incompatibilities."

#: ../../README.md:16
msgid "If you don't have Syringe installed into your mod already, you can download it together with the [latest Ares package](https://launchpad.net/ares/+download). To install simply drop `Syringe.exe` into your game folder (where your `gamemd.exe` is located). It's highly recommended to **install Ares** too to get full Phobos feature set, just drop all the files from the archive except documentation folder into your game folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../README.md:17
msgid "Obtain a Phobos \"package\" (official builds can be found on [releases page](https://github.com/Phobos-developers/Phobos/releases); read below to learn how to get nightly builds). You should end up with two files: `Phobos.dll` and `Phobos.pdb`."

#: ../../README.md:19
msgid "To launch the game with Phobos (and all other installed Syringe-compatible engine extensions including Ares) you need to execute `Syringe.exe \"gamemd.exe\" [command line arguments for gamemd.exe]` in command line (omit arguments if you don't need any). `RunAres.bat` from Ares package does the same so you may use that as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../README.md:21
msgid "If you already use Ares in your mod, you just need to drop Phobos files mentioned above in your game folder, Syringe will load Phobos automatically. This also applies to mods using XNA client with Syringe; if your mod doesn't use Syringe and Ares (or you just haven't set up the client) yet we recommend to use [CnCNet client mod base by Starkku](https://github.com/Starkku/cncnet-client-mod-base) which is compatible with Ares and Phobos out of the box."

There are two ways to get a nightly build."
