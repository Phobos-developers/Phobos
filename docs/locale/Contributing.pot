msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:167
msgid "You can observe how the stuff works by using the engine and note which other stuff influences the behavior, but sooner or later you would want to see the innards of that. This is usually done using such tools as disassemblers/decompilers ([IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/), [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)) to decipher what is written in the binary (`gamemd.exe` in case of the binary) and debuggers ([Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org)'s debugger is pretty good for that) to trace how the binary works."

msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:1
msgid "[Assembly language](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) and C++ knowledge, understanding of computer architecture, memory structure, OOP and compiler theory would certainly help."

msgid "Development"
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:179
msgid "When you found out how the engine works and where you need to extend the logic you'd need to develop the code to achieve what you want. This is done by declaring a *hook* - some code which would be executed after the program execution reaches the certain address in binary. All the development is done in C++ using [YRpp](https://github.com/Phobos-developers/YRpp) (which provides a way to interact with YR code and inject code using Syringe) and usually [Visual Studio 2017/2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or newer."

msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:183
msgid "To contribute a feature or some sort of a change you you would need a Git client (I recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) personally). Fork, clone the repo, preferably make a new branch, then edit/add the code or whatever you want to contribute. Commit, push, start a pull request, wait for it to get reviewed, or merged."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:1
msgid "Every pull request push trigger a nightly build for the latest pushed commit, so you can check the build status at the bottom of PR page, press `Show all checks`, go to details of a build run and get the zip containing built DLL and PDB (for your testers, f. ex.), or download a build from an automatically posted comment."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:1
msgid "You'd benefit from C++ experience, knowledge of programming patterns, common techniques etc. [Basic assembly knowledge](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) would help to correctly write the interaction with the memory where you hook at. Basic understanding of Git and GitHub is also needed."

msgid "Testing"
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:195
msgid "This is a job that any modder (and even sometimes player) can do. Look at a new feature or a change, try to think of all possible cases when it can work differently, try to think of any possible logic flaws, edge cases, unforeseen interactions or conditions etc., then test it according to your thoughts. Any bugs should be reported to issues section of this repo, if possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:1
msgid "**General stability** can only be achieved by extensive play-testing of new changes, both offline and online. Most modders have beta testing teams, so please, if you want the extension to be stable - contribute to that by having your testers play with the new features! Also the check-list below can help you identify issues quicker."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:201
msgid "Testing check-list"
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:203
msgid "**All possible valid use cases covered**. Try to check all of the valid feature use cases you can think of and verify that they work as intended with the feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:204
msgid "**Correct saving and loading**. Most of the additions like new INI tags require storing them in saved object info. Sometimes this is not done correctly, especially on complex stuff (like radiation types). Please, ensure all the improvements work __identically__ before and after being saved and loaded (on the same version of Phobos, of course)."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:205
msgid "**Interaction with other features**. Try to use the feature chained or interacting with other features from vanilla or other libs (for example, mind control removal warhead initially was crashing when trying to remove mind control from a permanently mind-controlled unit)."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:206
msgid "**Overlapping features not working correctly** (including those from third-party libs like Ares, HAres, CnCNet spawner DLL). Think of what features' code could overlap (in a technical sense; means they modify the same code) with what you're currently testing. Due to the nature of the project some features from other libs could happen to not work as expected if they are overlapping (for example, when implementing mass selection filtering Ares' `GroupAs` was initially broken and units using it weren't being type selected properly)."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:207
msgid "**Edge cases**. Those are the cases of some specific cases usually induced by some extreme  parameter values (for example, vanilla game crashes on zero-size `PreviewPack` instead of not drawing it)."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:208
msgid "**Corner cases**. Those are similar to edge cases but are hard to reproduce and are usually induced by a combination of extreme parameter values."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:1
msgid "Knowledge on how to mod YR and having an inquisitive mind, being attentive to details would help."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:214
msgid "Writing docs"
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:216
msgid "No explanation needed. If you fully understand how some stuff in Phobos works you can help by writing a detailed description in these docs, or you can just improve the pieces of docs you think are not detailed enough."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:218
msgid "The docs are written in Markdown (which is dead simple, [learn MD in 60 seconds](https://commonmark.org/help/); if you need help on extended syntax have a look at [MyST parser reference](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/)). We use [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/) to build docs, [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.io/) to host."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:1
msgid "You don't need to install Python, Sphinx and modules to see changes - every pull request you make is being built and served by Read the Docs automatically. Just like the nightly builds, scroll to the bottom, press `Show all checks` and see the built documentation in the details of a build run."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:224
msgid "There are two ways to edit the docs."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:225
msgid "**Edit from your PC**. Pretty much the same like what's described in [contributing changes section](#contributing-changes-to-the-project); the docs are located in the `docs` folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:226
msgid "**Edit via online editor**. Navigate to the doc piece that you want to edit, press the button on the top right - and it will take you to the file at GitHub which you would need to edit (look for the pencil icon to the top right). Press it - the fork will be created and you'll edit the docs in your version of the repo (fork). You can commit those changes (preferably to a new branch) and make them into a pull request to main repo."
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:1
msgid "OK English grammar and understanding of docs structure would be enough. You would also need a GitHub account."

msgid "Providing media to showcase features"
msgstr ""

#: ../Contributing.md:234
msgid "Those would be used in docs and with a link to the respective mod as a bonus for the mod author. To record GIFs you can use such apps as, for example, [GifCam](http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/)."
