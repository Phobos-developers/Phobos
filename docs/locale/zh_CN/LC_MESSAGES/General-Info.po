"*stable builds* - those are numbered like your regular versions "
"(something close to semantic versioning, e.g. version 1.2.3 for example) "
"and ideally should contain no bugs, therefore are safe to use in mods;"
msgstr "**稳定版**：采用常规版本号（例如 v1.2.3），并且理论上不包含任何此前已知的 Bug，可以安全地用于 Mod。"

"*development builds* - those are the builds which contain functionality "
"that needs to be tested. They are numbered plainly starting from 0 and "
"incrementing the number on each release. Mod authors still can include "
"those versions with their mods if they want latest features, though we "
"can't guarantee lack of bugs;"
msgstr ""
"**开发版**：包含待测试功能的版本，采用 `build-` 加上从 `0` 开始且每次发布后递增的简单数字编号作为版本号。Mod "
"作者仍可在 Mod 中使用这类版本以获得最新功能，但我们无法保证它们没有 Bug。"

#: ../../General-Info.md:10
msgid ""
"*nightly builds* - bleeding edge versions which can include prototypes, "
"proofs of concepts, scrapped features etc., in other words - we can't "
"guarantee anything in those builds and they absolutely should NOT be used"
" in mod releases and should only be used to help with development and "
"testing."
msgstr ""
"**每夜构建**：最前沿版本，可能包含原型机、理论验证、废弃功能等。换而言之我们无法保证这些版本的稳定性，它们仅应当用于协助 Phobos "
"开发和测试而绝不应该用于 Mod 的发布版本。"

msgid ""
"**DISCLAIMER:** We understand that everyone wants to try and use the new "
"features as soon as they're released, but we can't do all the testing "
"ourselves, so we only test the functionality on a basic level. We ask "
"everyone who uses the new development build first to **test the new "
"changes in every possible way first before disabling the development "
"build warning** and proceeding to include the build in your mod release. "
"This would allow us to concentrate on implementing the actual features, "
"which is the most complex task. Learn more on testing "
"[here](Contributing.md#testing)."
msgstr ""
"**免责声明**：我们理解每个人都希望尽快体验新功能的愿望，但我们仅可进行基础的功能验证而无法完成全面的测试。我们要求所有用户在关闭开发版本警告前务必通过各种方式全面测试变更内容，然后再将开发版本使用于"
" Mod 的发布版本中。这将使我们能够专注于实现最复杂的核心功能。测试指南见 [此处](Contributing.md#testing)。"

"You can hide the warning by specifying the build number after `-b=` as a "

msgid "Saved games filtering"
msgstr "存档过滤"

#: ../../General-Info.md:20
msgid ""
"Phobos fully supports saving and loading thanks to prototype code from "
"publicly released Ares 0.A source and it implements it's own filtering "
"which shouldn't conflict with Ares save filtering. Save games between "
"different versions are incompatible due to changes to Phobos extension "
"classes which are present in almost every build release. The filtering "
"mechanism, hovewer, doesn't apply to nightly versions - those use latest "
"development build number on which this nightly is based on. While "
"different nightly version saves may be listed, they are most likely "
"incompatible in case there were changes to extension class fields."
msgstr ""
"得益于 Ares0.A 公开的源码范例，Phobos 完全支持存读档功能，并且实现了独立的过滤机制，这与 Ares 的存档过滤机制没有冲突。由于 "
"Phobos "
"扩展类几乎在每个版本都有所变动，所以不同版本间的存档互不兼容。但过滤机制不适用于每夜构建版本——这些版本使用其所基于的最新开发版本的编号。虽然不同每夜构建版本的存档可能显示在存读档列表中，但如果扩展类字段发生了变动，那么这些存档很可能实际上并不兼容。"

"or improving existing ones is done with compatibility with those in mind."

"While we would also like to support HAres we can't guarantee "

msgstr "尽管我们也希望支持 HAres，但由于其用户群体及开发者与国际社区分离，所以我们无法保证兼容性。但我们欢迎就此问题提供任何帮助！"
