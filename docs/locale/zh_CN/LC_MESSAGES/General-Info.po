#: ../General-Info.md:8
msgid ""
"*stable builds* - those are numbered like your regular versions "
"(something close to semantic versioning, e.g. version 1.2.3 for example) "
"and ideally should contain no bugs, therefore are safe to use in mods;"
msgstr ""

#: ../General-Info.md:9
msgid ""
"*development builds* - those are the builds which contain functionality "
"that needs to be tested. They are numbered plainly starting from 0 and "
"incrementing the number on each release. Mod authors still can include "
"those versions with their mods if they want latest features, though we "
"can't guarantee lack of bugs;"

#: ../General-Info.md:10
msgid ""
"*nightly builds* - bleeding edge versions which can include prototypes, "
"proofs of concepts, scrapped features etc., in other words - we can't "
"guarantee anything in those builds and they absolutely should NOT be used"
" in mod releases and should only be used to help with development and "
"testing."

"**DISCLAIMER:** We understand that everyone wants to try and use the new "
"features as soon as they're released, but we can't do all the testing "
"ourselves, so we only test the functionality on a basic level. We ask "
"everyone who uses the new development build first to **test the new "
"changes in every possible way first before disabling the development "
"build warning** and proceeding to include the build in your mod release. "
"This would allow us to concentrate on implementing the actual features, "
"which is the most complex task. Learn more on testing "
"[here](Contributing.md#testing)."

msgid ""
"Phobos fully supports saving and loading thanks to prototype code from "
"publicly released Ares 0.A source and it implements it's own filtering "
"which shouldn't conflict with Ares save filtering. Save games between "
"different versions are incompatible due to changes to Phobos extension "
"classes which are present in almost every build release. The filtering "
"mechanism, hovewer, doesn't apply to nightly versions - those use latest "
"development build number on which this nightly is based on. While "
"different nightly version saves may be listed, they are most likely "
"incompatible in case there were changes to extension class fields."

"While Phobos is standalone, it is designed to be used alongside "
"[Ares](https://ares.strategy-x.com) and [CnCNet5 "

"While we would also like to support HAres we can't guarantee "
