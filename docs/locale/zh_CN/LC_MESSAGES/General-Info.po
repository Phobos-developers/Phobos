"*stable builds* - those are numbered like your regular versions "
"(something close to semantic versioning, e.g. version 1.2.3 for example) "
"and ideally should contain no bugs, therefore are safe to use in mods;"

"*development builds* - those are the builds which contain functionality "
"that needs to be tested. They are numbered plainly starting from 0 and "

"those versions with their mods if they want latest features, though we "
"can't guarantee lack of bugs;"

"*nightly builds* - bleeding edge versions which can include prototypes, "
"proofs of concepts, scrapped features etc., in other words - we can't "
"guarantee anything in those builds and they absolutely should NOT be used"
" in mod releases and should only be used to help with development and "
"testing."
msgstr "**每日生成**：这些版本是最新的版本，包括有原型，概念证明，废弃功能等等，换句话说，我们不能保证这种版本的稳定性，绝对不应在mod中使用这种版本，仅用于帮助开发与测试。"

"**DISCLAIMER:** We understand that everyone wants to try and use the new "
"features as soon as they're released, but we can't do all the testing "
"ourselves, so we only test the functionality on a basic level. We ask "
"everyone who uses the new development build first to **test the new "
"changes in every possible way first before disabling the development "
"build warning** and proceeding to include the build in your mod release. "
"This would allow us to concentrate on implementing the actual features, "
"which is the most complex task. Learn more on testing "
"[here](Contributing.md#testing)."
msgstr "**声明**：我们理解每个人都想要在刚出炉的时候尝试和使用最新的功能，但我们自己不可能做完全部的测试，我们只能在最基础的层面测试。因此我们要求使用最新的开发版的每个人在关闭开发版本警告之前使用一切手段测试新的改变，然后就可以将开发版使用在mod的发行版本中了。这将允许我们将集中在最复杂的实现具体功能上，了解更多请见[此处](Contributing.md#testing)。"

"You can hide the warning by specifying the build number after `-b=` as a "

msgid ""
"Phobos fully supports saving and loading thanks to prototype code from "
"publicly released Ares 0.A source and it implements it's own filtering "
"which shouldn't conflict with Ares save filtering. Save games between "
"different versions are incompatible due to changes to Phobos extension "
"classes which are present in almost every build release. The filtering "
"mechanism, hovewer, doesn't apply to nightly versions - those use latest "
"development build number on which this nightly is based on. While "
"different nightly version saves may be listed, they are most likely "
"incompatible in case there were changes to extension class fields."
msgstr "火卫一完全支持存档读档，感谢Ares 0.A开源代码中的原型代码。我们的存档过滤与Ares的存档过滤不会产生冲突。在火卫一不同版本之间，我们会对火卫一的扩展类进行更改，因此不同版本之间的存档是不通用的。但是须注意过滤机制对每日生成没有作用，因此如果扩展类发生了改变，那么存档很有可能不兼容。"

"or improving existing ones is done with compatibility with those in mind."

"matter though!"
msgstr "尽管我们也希望支持HAres，但是由于其用户群体与开发者与国际社区的分割，我们不保证兼容性。不过，我们随时欢迎你们的任何帮助！"
