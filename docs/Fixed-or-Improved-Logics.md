# Fixed / Improved Logics

This page describes all ingame logics that are fixed or improved in Phobos without adding anything significant.

## Bugfixes and miscellanous

- Fixed the bug when deploying mindcontrolled vehicle into a building permanently trasferred the control to the house which mindcontrolled it.
- SHP debris shadows now respect the `Shadow` tag.
- Allowed usage of TileSet of 255 and above without making NE-SW broken bridges unrepairable.
- `TurretOffset` tag for voxel turreted technos now accepts FLH (forward, lateral, height) values like `TurretOffset=F,L` or `TurretOffset=F,L,H`, which means turret location can be adjusted in all three axes.
- `InfiniteMindControl` with `Damage=1` can now control more than 1 unit.

- Vehicle to building deployers now keep their target when deploying with `DeployToFire`.

## Vehicles

### Customizable disk laser radius

![image](_static/images/disklaser-radius-values-01.gif)  
- You can now set disk laser animation radius using a new tag.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEWEAPON]          ; WeaponType
DiskLaser.Radius=38.2 ; floating point value
                      ; 38.2 is roughly the default saucer disk radius
```

### Kill spawns on low power

- `Powered=yes` structures that spawns aircraft like Aircrafts Carriers will stop targeting the enemy if low power.
- Spawned aircrafts self-destruct if they are flying.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMESTRUCTURE]       ; BuildingType
Powered.KillSpawns=no ; boolean
```

## Terrain

### Customizable ore spawners

- You can now specify which type of tiberium certain TerrainType would generate.
- It's also now possible to specify a range value for an ore generation area different compared to standard 3x3 rectangle. Ore will be uniformly distributed across all affected cells in a spread range.
- You can specify which tiberium growth stage will be spawned. Corresponding tag accepts either a single integer value or two comma-separated values to allow randomized growth stages from the range (inclusive).

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMETERRAINTYPE]             ; TerrainType
SpawnsTiberium.Type=0         ; tiberium type index
SpawnsTiberium.Range=1        ; integer, radius in cells
SpawnsTiberium.GrowthStage=3  ; single int / comma-sep. range
```
