# Fixed / Improved Logics

This page describes all ingame logics that are fixed or improved in Phobos without adding anything significant.

## Bugfixes and miscellaneous

- Fixed the bug when reading a map which puts `Preview(Pack)` after `Map` lead to the game fail to draw the preview
- Fixed the bug when retinting map lighting with a map action corrupted light sources.
- Fixed the bug when deploying mindcontrolled vehicle into a building permanently transferred the control to the house which mindcontrolled it.
- Fixed the bug when units are already dead but still in map (for sinking, crashing, dying animation, etc.), they could die again.
- Fixed the bug when cloaked Desolator was unable to fire his deploy weapon.
- Fixed the bug that temporaryed unit cannot be erased correctly and no longer raise an error.
- Fixed `DebrisMaximums` (spawned debris type amounts cannot go beyond specified maximums anymore). Only applied when `DebrisMaximums` values amount is more than 1 for compatibility reasons.
- Fixed building and defense tab hotkeys not enabling the placement mode after `Cannot build here.` triggered and the placement mode cancelled.
- Fixed buildings with `UndeployInto` playing `EVA_NewRallypointEstablished` on undeploying.
- Fixed buildings with `Naval=yes` ignoring `WaterBound=no` to be forced to place onto water.
- Fixed AI Aircraft docks bug when Ares tag `[GlobalControls]` > `AllowParallelAIQueues=no` is set.
- Fixed laser drawing code to allow for thicker lasers in house color draw mode.
- Fixed `DeathWeapon` not detonating properly.
  - Some settings are still ignored like `PreImpactAnim` *(Ares feature)*, this might change in future.
- Fixed the bug when occupied building's `MuzzleFlashX` is drawn on the center of the building when `X` goes past 10.
- Fixed jumpjet units that are `Crashable` not crashing to ground properly if destroyed while being pulled by a `Locomotor` warhead.
- Fixed jumpjet units being unable to turn to the target when firing from a different direction.
- Fixed interaction of `UnitAbsorb` & `InfantryAbsorb` with `Grinding` buildings. The keys will now make the building only accept appropriate types of objects.
- Fixed missing 'no enter' cursor for VehicleTypes being unable to enter a `Grinding` building.
- Fixed Engineers being able to enter `Grinding` buildings even when they shouldn't (such as ally building at full HP).

- SHP debris shadows now respect the `Shadow` tag.
- Allowed usage of TileSet of 255 and above without making NE-SW broken bridges unrepairable.
- Adds a "Load Game" button to the retry dialog on mission failure.

![image](_static/images/turretoffset-01.png)
*Side offset voxel turret in Breaking Blue project*

- `TurretOffset` tag for voxel turreted TechnoTypes now accepts FLH (forward, lateral, height) values like `TurretOffset=F,L` or `TurretOffset=F,L,H`, which means turret location can be adjusted in all three axes.
- `InfiniteMindControl` with `Damage=1` can now control more than 1 unit.
- Aircraft with `Fighter` set to false or those using strafing pattern (weapon projectile `ROT` is below 2) now take weapon's `Burst` into accord for all shots instead of just the first one.
- `EMEffect` used for random AnimList pick is now replaced by a new tag `AnimList.PickRandom` with no side effect. (EMEffect=yes on AA inviso projectile deals no damage to units in movement)
- Vehicles using `DeployFire` will now explicitly use weapon specified by `DeployFireWeapon` for firing the deploy weapon and respect `FireOnce` setting on weapon and any stop commands issued during firing.
- Infantry with `DeployFireWeapon=-1` can now fire both weapons (decided by its target), regardless of deployed or not.

![image](_static/images/remember-target-after-deploying-01.gif)
*Nod arty keeping target on attack order in [C&C: Reloaded](https://www.moddb.com/mods/cncreloaded/)*

- Vehicle to building deployers now keep their target when deploying with `DeployToFire`.
- Effects like lasers are no longer drawn from wrong firing offset on weapons that use Burst.
- Animations can now be offset on the X axis with `XDrawOffset`.
- `IsSimpleDeployer` units now only play `DeploySound` and `UndeploySound` once, when done with (un)deploying instead of repeating it over duration of turning and/or `DeployingAnim`.
- AITrigger can now recognize Building Upgrades as legal condition.
- `EWGates` and `NSGates` now will link walls like `xxGateOne` and `xxGateTwo` do.
- Fixed the bug when occupied building's `MuzzleFlashX` is drawn on the center of the building when `X` goes past 10.
- Fixed jumpjet units that are `Crashable` not crashing to ground properly if destroyed while being pulled by a `Locomotor` warhead.
- Fixed interaction of `UnitAbsorb` & `InfantryAbsorb` with `Grinding` buildings. The keys will now make the building only accept appropriate types of objects.
- Fixed missing 'no enter' cursor for VehicleTypes being unable to enter a `Grinding` building.
- Fixed Engineers being able to enter `Grinding` buildings even when they shouldn't (such as ally building at full HP).
- Aircraft & jumpjet units are now affected by speed modifiers such as `SpeedAircraft/Infantry/UnitsMult` on `Countries`, `VeteranSpeed` and Crates / AttachEffect (Ares feature).
- Both voxel and SHP vehicle units should now correctly respect custom palette set through `Palette`.
- Weapons fired by EMPulse superweapons without `EMPulse.TargetSelf=true` *(Ares feature)* can now create radiation.
- Setting `RadarInvisible` to true on TerrainTypes now hides them from minimap display.
- Mind control indicator animations will now correctly restore on mind controlled objects when uncloaked.
- Animations from Warhead `AnimList` & `SplashList` etc. as well as animations created through map trigger `41 Play Anim At` now have the appropriate house set as owner of the animation by default.
- Nuke carrier & payload weapons now respect `Bright` setting on the weapons always when appropriate (previously only payload did and only if Superweapon had `Nuke.SiloLaunch=false` *(Ares feature)*).
- Self-healing pips from `InfantryGainSelfHeal` & `UnitsGainSelfHeal` now respect unit's `PixelSelectionBracketDelta` like health bar pips do.
- Buildings using `SelfHealing` will now correctly revert to undamaged graphics if their health is restored back by self-healing.
- Anim owner is now set for warhead AnimList/SplashList anims and Play Anim at Waypoint trigger animations.
- Allow use of `Foundation=0x0` on TerrainTypes without crashing for similar results as for buildings.
- Projectiles now remember the house of the firer even if the firer is destroyed before the projectile detonates. Does not currently apply to some Ares-introduced Warhead effects like EMP.
- `OpenTopped` transports now take `OpenTransportWeapon` setting of passengers into consideration when determining weapon range used for threat scanning and approaching targets.
- Trailer animations now inherit the owner of the object (animation, projectile or aircraft) they are attached to.
- Buildings now correctly use laser parameters set for Secondary weapons instead of reading them from Primary weapon.
- Fixed an issue that caused vehicles killed by damage dealt by a known house but without a known source TechnoType (f.ex animation warhead damage) to not be recorded as killed correctly and thus not spring map trigger events etc.
- `IsAnimated`, `AnimationRate` and `AnimationProbability` now work on TerrainTypes without `SpawnsTiberium` set to true.

![image](_static/images/translucency-fix.png)
*Example gradient SHP drawing with 75% translucency, before and after*

- Translucent RLE SHPs will now be drawn using a more precise and performant algorithm that has no green tint and banding. Can be disabled with `rulesmd.ini->[General]->FixTransparencyBlitters=no`.
  - Only applies to Z-aware drawing mode for now.

## Animations

### Animation weapon and damage settings

- `Weapon` can be set to a WeaponType, to create a projectile and immediately detonate it instead of simply dealing `Damage` by `Warhead`. This allows weapon effects to be applied.
- `Damage.Delay` determines delay between two applications of `Damage`. Requires `Damage` to be set to 1.0 or above. Value of 0 disables the delay. Keep in mind that this is measured in animation frames, not game frames. Depending on `Rate`, animation may or may not advance animation frames on every game frame.
- `Damage.DealtByInvoker`, if set to true, makes any `Damage` dealt to be considered as coming from the animation's invoker (f.ex, firer of the weapon if it is Warhead `AnimList/SplashList` animation, the destroyed vehicle if it is `DestroyAnim` animation or the object the animation is attached to). Does not affect which house the `Damage` dealt by `Warhead` is dealt by.
- `Damage.ApplyOncePerLoop`, if set to true, makes `Damage` be dealt only once per animation loop (on single loop animations, only once, period) instead of on every frame or intervals defined by `Damage.Delay`. The frame on which it is dealt is determined by `Damage.Delay`, defaulting to after the first animation frame.

In `artmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEANIM]                     ; AnimationType
Weapon=                        ; WeaponType
Damage.Delay=0                 ; integer, animation frames
Damage.DealtByInvoker=false    ; boolean
Damage.ApplyOncePerLoop=false  ; boolean
```

```{note}
`Weapon` and `Damage.Delay`, beyond the other additions, should function similarly to the equivalent features introduced by Ares and take precedence over them if Phobos is used together with Ares.
```

### Attached animation position customization

- You can now customize whether or not animations attached to objects are centered at the object's actual center rather than the bottom of their top-leftmost cell (cell #0).

In `artmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEANIM]                       ; AnimationType
UseCenterCoordsIfAttached=false  ; boolean
```

### Layer on animations attached to objects

- You can now customize whether or not animations attached to objects follow the object's layer or respect their own `Layer` setting. If this is unset, attached animations use `ground` layer.

In `artmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEANIM]             ; AnimationType
Layer.UseObjectLayer=  ; boolean
```

### Ore stage threshold for `HideIfNoOre`

- You can now customize which growth stage should an ore/tiberium cell have to have animation with `HideIfNoOre` displayed. Cells with growth stage less than specified value won't allow the anim to display.

In `artmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEANIM]               ; AnimationType
HideIfNoOre.Threshold=0  ; integer, minimal ore growth stage
```

## Buildings

### Customizable & new grinder properties

- You can now customize which types of objects a building with `Grinding` set can grind as well as the grinding sound.
  - `Grinding.AllowAllies` changes whether or not to allow units to enter allies' buildings.
  - `Grinding.AllowOwner` changes whether or not to allow units to enter your own buildings.
  - `Grinding.AllowTypes` can be used to define InfantryTypes and VehicleTypes that can be grinded by the building. Listing any will disable grinding for all types except those listed.
  - `Grinding.DisallowTypes` can be used to exclude InfantryTypes or VehicleTypes from being able to enter the grinder building.
  - `Grinding.Sound` is a sound played by when object is grinded by the building. If not set, defaults to `[AudioVisual]`->`EnterGrinderSound`.
  - `Grinding.Weapon` is a weapon fired at the building & by the building when it grinds an object. Will only be fired if at least weapon's `ROF` amount of frames have passed since it was last fired.
  - `Grinding.DisplayRefund` can be set to display the amount of credits acquired upon grinding on the building. Multiple refunded objects within a short period of time have their refund amounts coalesced into single display.
    - `Grinding.DisplayRefund.Houses` determines which houses can see the credits display.
    - `Grinding.DisplayRefund.Offset` is additional pixel offset for the center of the credits display, by default (0,0) at building's center.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEBUILDING]                     ; BuildingType
Grinding.AllowAllies=false         ; boolean
Grinding.AllowOwner=true           ; boolean
Grinding.AllowTypes=               ; List of InfantryTypes / VehicleTypes
Grinding.DisallowTypes=            ; List of InfantryTypes / VehicleTypes
Grinding.Sound=                    ; Sound
Grinding.Weapon=                   ; WeaponType
Grinding.DisplayRefund=false       ; boolean
Grinding.DisplayRefund.Houses=All  ; Affected House Enumeration (none|owner/self|allies/ally|team|enemies/enemy|all)
Grinding.DisplayRefund.Offset=0,0  ; X,Y, pixels relative to default
```

## Projectiles

### Customizable projectile gravity

-  You can now specify individual projectile gravity.
    - Setting `Gravity=0` is not recommended as it will cause the projectile to fly backwards and be unable to hit the target which is not at the same height. We suggest to use `Straight` Trajectory instead. See [here](New-or-Enhanced-Logics.md#projectile-trajectories).

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEPROJECTILE]        ; Projectile
Gravity=6.0             ; floating point value
```

## Technos

### Building-provided self-healing customization

- It is now possible to set a global cap for the effects of `InfantryGainSelfHeal` and `UnitsGainSelfHeal` by setting `InfantryGainSelfHealCap` & `UnitsGainSelfHealCap` under `[General]`, respectively.
- It is also possible to change the pip frames displayed from `pips.shp` individually for infantry, units and buildings by setting the frames for infantry & unit self-healing on `Pips.SelfHeal.Infantry/Units/Buildings` under `[AudioVisual]`, respectively.
  - `Pips.SelfHeal.Infantry/Units/Buildings.Offset` can be used to customize the pixel offsets for the displayed pips, individually for infantry, units and buildings.
- Whether or not a TechnoType benefits from effects of `InfantryGainSelfHeal` or `UnitsGainSelfHeal` buildings or neither can now be controlled by setting `SelfHealGainType`.
  - If `SelfHealGainType` is not set, InfantryTypes and VehicleTypes with `Organic` set to true gain self-healing from `InfantryGainSelfHeal`, other VehicleTypes from `UnitsGainSelfHeal` and AircraftTypes & BuildingTypes never gain self-healing.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[General]
InfantryGainSelfHealCap=               ; integer, maximum amount of InfantryGainSelfHeal that can be in effect at once, must be 1 or higher
UnitsGainSelfHealCap=                  ; integer, maximum amount of UnitsGainSelfHeal that can be in effect at once, must be 1 or higher

[AudioVisual]
Pips.SelfHeal.Infantry=13,20           ; integer, frames of pips.shp for infantry & unit-self healing pips, respectively
Pips.SelfHeal.Units=13,20              ; integer, frames of pips.shp for infantry & unit-self healing pips, respectively
Pips.SelfHeal.Buildings=13,20          ; integer, frames of pips.shp for infantry & unit-self healing pips, respectively
Pips.SelfHeal.Infantry.Offset=25,-35   ; X,Y, pixels relative to default
Pips.SelfHeal.Units.Offset=33,-32      ; X,Y, pixels relative to default
Pips.SelfHeal.Buildings.Offset=15,10   ; X,Y, pixels relative to default

[SOMETECHNO]                           ; TechnoType
SelfHealGainType=                      ; Self-Heal Gain Type Enumeration (none|infantry|units)
```

### Customizable harvester ore gathering animation

![image](_static/images/oregath.gif)
*Custom ore gathering anims in [Project Phantom](https://www.moddb.com/mods/project-phantom)*

- You can now specify which anim should be drawn when a harvester of specified type is gathering specified type of ore.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMETECHNO]                     ; TechnoType
OreGathering.Anims=              ; list of animations
OreGathering.FramesPerDir=15     ; list of integers
OreGathering.Tiberiums=0         ; list of Tiberium IDs
```

### Customizable Teleport/Chrono Locomotor settings per TechnoType

![image](_static/images/cust-Chrono.gif)
*Chrono Legionnaire and Ronco (hero) from [YR:New War](https://www.moddb.com/mods/yuris-revenge-new-war)*

- You can now specify Teleport/Chrono Locomotor settings per TechnoType to override default rules values. Unfilled values default to values in `[General]`.
- Only applicable to Techno that have Teleport/Chrono Locomotor attached.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMETECHNO]            ; TechnoType
WarpOut=                ; Anim (played when Techno warping out)
WarpIn=                 ; Anim (played when Techno warping in)
WarpAway=               ; Anim (played when Techno chronowarped by chronosphere)
ChronoTrigger=          ; boolean, if yes then delay varies by distance, if no it is a constant
ChronoDistanceFactor=   ; integer, amount to divide the distance to destination by to get the warped out delay
ChronoMinimumDelay=     ; integer, the minimum delay for teleporting, no matter how short the distance
ChronoRangeMinimum=     ; integer, can be used to set a small range within which the delay is constant
ChronoDelay=            ; integer, delay after teleport for chronosphere
```

### Customizable unit image in art

- `Image` tag in art INI is no longer limited to AnimationTypes and BuildingTypes, and can be applied to all TechnoTypes (InfantryTypes, VehicleTypes, AircraftTypes, BuildingTypes).
- The tag specifies **only** the file name (without extension) of the asset that replaces TechnoType's graphics. If the name in `Image` is also an entry in the art INI, **no tags will be read from it**.
- **By default this feature is disabled** to remain compatible with YR. To use this feature, enable it in rules with `ArtImageSwap=true`.
- This feature supports SHP images for InfantryTypes, SHP and VXL images for VehicleTypes and VXL images for AircraftTypes.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[General]
ArtImageSwap=false  ; disabled by default
```

In `artmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMETECHNO]
Image=              ; name of the file that will be used as image, without extension
```

### Customize resource storage

- Now Ares `Storage` feature can set which Tiberium type from `[Tiberiums]` list should be used for storing resources in structures with `Refinery.UseStorage=yes` and `Storage` > 0.
- This tag can not be used without Ares.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[General]
Storage.TiberiumIndex=-1  ; integer, [Tiberiums] list index
```

### Jumpjet unit layer deviation customization

- Allows turning on or off jumpjet unit behaviour where they fluctuate between `air` and `top` layers based on whether or not their current altitude is equal / below or above `JumpjetHeight` or `[JumpjetControls] -> CruiseHeight` if former is not set on TechnoType. If disabled, airborne jumpjet units exist only in `air` layer. `JumpjetAllowLayerDeviation` defaults to value of `[JumpjetControls] -> AllowLayerDeviation` if not specified.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[JumpjetControls]
AllowLayerDeviation=true         ; boolean

[SOMETECHNO]                     ; TechnoType
JumpjetAllowLayerDeviation=true  ; boolean
```

### Jumpjet facing target customization

- Allows jumpjet units to face towards the target when firing from different directions. Set `[JumpjetControls] -> TurnToTarget=yes` to enable it for all jumpjet locomotor units. This behavior can be overriden by setting `[UnitType] -> JumpjetTurnToTarget` for specific units.
- This behavior does not apply to `TurretSpins=yes` units for obvious reasons.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[JumpjetControls]
TurnToTarget=false     ; boolean

[SOMEUNITTYPE]         ; UnitType with jumpjet locomotor
JumpjetTurnToTarget=   ; boolean, override the tag in JumpjetControls
```


### Kill spawns on low power

- `Powered=yes` structures that spawns aircraft like Aircrafts Carriers will stop targeting the enemy if low power.
- Spawned aircrafts self-destruct if they are flying.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMESTRUCTURE]          ; BuildingType
Powered.KillSpawns=false ; boolean
```

### Re-enable obsolete [JumpjetControls]

- Re-enable obsolete [JumpjetControls], the keys in it will be as the default value of jumpjet units.
  - Moreover, added two tags for missing ones.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[JumpjetControls]
Crash=5.0        ; floating point value
NoWobbles=false  ; boolean
```

```{note}
`CruiseHeight` is for `JumpjetHeight`, `WobblesPerSecond` is for `JumpjetWobbles`, `WobbleDeviation` is for `JumpjetDeviation`, and `Acceleration` is for `JumpjetAccel`. All other corresponding keys just simply have no Jumpjet prefix.
```

## Terrains

### Customizable ore spawners

![image](_static/images/ore-01.png)
*Different ore spawners in [Rise of the East](https://www.moddb.com/mods/riseoftheeast) mod*

- You can now specify which type of ore certain TerrainType would generate.
- It's also now possible to specify a range value for an ore generation area different compared to standard 3x3 rectangle. Ore will be uniformly distributed across all affected cells in a spread range.
- You can specify which ore growth stage will be spawned and how much cells will be filled with ore per ore generation animation. Corresponding tags accept either a single integer value or two comma-separated values to allow randomized growth stages from the range (inclusive).

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMETERRAINTYPE]             ; TerrainType
SpawnsTiberium.Type=0         ; tiberium/ore type index
SpawnsTiberium.Range=1        ; integer, radius in cells
SpawnsTiberium.GrowthStage=3  ; single int / comma-sep. range
SpawnsTiberium.CellsPerAnim=1 ; single int / comma-sep. range
```

### Minimap color customization

- TerrainTypes can now be made to display on minimap with different colors by setting `MinimapColor`.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMETERRAINTYPE]  ; TerrainType
MinimapColor=      ; integer - Red,Green,Blue
```

### Passable & buildable-upon TerrainTypes

- TerrainTypes can now be made passable or buildable upon by setting `IsPassable` or `CanBeBuiltOn`, respectively.
  - Movement cursor is displayed on `IsPassable` TerrainTypes unless force-firing.
  - `CanBeBuiltOn=true` terrain objects are removed when building is placed on them.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMETERRAINTYPE]   ; TerrainType
IsPassable=false    ; boolean
CanBeBuiltOn=false  ; boolean
```

## Tiberiums (ores)

### Minimap color customization

- Ore can now be made to display on minimap with different colors by setting `MinimapColor` on Tiberiums.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEORE]      ; Tiberium
MinimapColor=  ; integer - Red,Green,Blue
```

## Vehicles

### IsSimpleDeployer vehicle deploy animation / direction customization

- `DeployingAnim.AllowAnyDirection` if set, disables any direction constraints for deployers with `DeployingAnim` set. Only works for ground units.
- `DeployingAnim.KeepUnitVisible` determines if the unit is hidden while the animation is playing.
- `DeployingAnim.ReverseForUndeploy` controls whether or not the animation is played in reverse for undeploying.
- `DeployingAnim.UseUnitDrawer` controls whether or not the animation is displayed in the unit's palette and team colours or regular animation palette, including a potential custom palette.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEVEHICLE]                          ; VehicleType
DeployingAnim.AllowAnyDirection=false  ; boolean
DeployingAnim.KeepUnitVisible=false    ; boolean
DeployingAnim.ReverseForUndeploy=true  ; boolean
DeployingAnim.UseUnitDrawer=true       ; boolean
```

### Stationary vehicles

- Setting VehicleType `Speed` to 0 now makes game treat them as stationary, behaving in very similar manner to deployed vehicles with `IsSimpleDeployer` set to true. Should not be used on buildable vehicles, as they won't be able to exit factories.

## Warheads

### Allowing damage dealt to firer

- You can now allow warhead to deal damage (and apply damage-adjacent effects such as `KillDriver` and `DisableWeapons/Sonar/Flash.Duration` *(Ares features)*) on the object that is considered as the firer of the Warhead even if it does not have `DamageSelf=true`.
  - Note that effect of `Psychedelic=true`, despite being tied to damage will still fail to apply on the firer as it does not affect any objects belonging to same house as the firer, including itself.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEWARHEAD]            ; WarheadType
AllowDamageOnSelf=false  ; boolean
```

### Customizing decloak on damaging targets

- You can now specify whether or not the warhead decloaks objects that are damaged by the warhead.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEWARHEAD]               ; WarheadType
DecloakDamagedTargets=true  ; boolean
```

### Restricting screen shaking to current view

- You can now specify whether or not the warhead can only shake screen (`ShakeX/Ylo/hi`) if it is detonated while visible on current screen view.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEWARHEAD]       ; WarheadType
ShakeIsLocal=false  ; boolean
```

## Weapons

### Customizable disk laser radius

![image](_static/images/disklaser-radius-values-01.gif)
- You can now set disk laser animation radius using a new tag.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEWEAPON]          ; WeaponType
DiskLaser.Radius=38.2 ; floating point value
                      ; 38.2 is roughly the default saucer disk radius
```

### Single-color lasers

- You can now set laser to draw using only `LaserInnerColor` by setting `IsSingleColor`, in same manner as `IsHouseColor` lasers do using player's team color. These lasers respect laser thickness. Note that this is not available on prism support weapons.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEWEAPON]         ; WeaponType
IsSingleColor=false  ; boolean
```

### Toggle-able ElectricBolt visuals

- You can now specify individual ElectricBolt bolts you want to disable. Note that this is only a visual change.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[SOMEWEAPONTYPE]       ; WeaponType
IsElectricBolt=true    ; an ElectricBolt Weapon, vanilla tag
Bolt.Disable1=false    ; boolean
Bolt.Disable2=false    ; boolean
Bolt.Disable3=false    ; boolean
```
